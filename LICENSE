Do whatever you want with this. I make no guarantees about it being up to date on any versions of React Native as that's a fast moving target, and if Smash.gg changes their API at some point then that'll obviously also cause issues. I'm open sourcing it moreso to gauge how much the community likes the idea, and to pass on all of this should someone else wanna pick it up and mess around with it.

I guess the only restriction would be that if you use this, just throw some credit somewhere. I'm not too particular as to where. Anything that's copyright Smash.gg is theirs and theirs alone, and I make no claims otherwise.
